or we can add new users at the lastline above
<user username="admin" password="admin@123" role="admin-gui, manager-gui"\> like this we need to add
do find / - name context.xml you will get context.xml files in webapps mostly it will be 4 files comment valves in it by using <!-- in the begining and --> at the end
copy the .war file and place it in webapps
after that do bin/sh startup.sh to start tomat sh shutdown.sh to stop the tomcat 
you can check sudo netstat -lntp the port number of tomcat is 8080 and it requires java to run tomcat as prereuqsite you need to check java installed or not
then do curl http://localhost:8080/"warfilename which we places in webapps" you will be redirected to the app
